This was an enormous effort, but it will solve a host of problems that we have\\nhad since the Shelley phase. It will take time to properly review it, and we will\\nneed to put in a lot of effort to integrate it with the downstream components, but this is  a huge\\nmilestone. Additionally, we have a new CIP proposing a deprecation cycle for the transaction\\nserialization schemes.\\n\\nWe also have a draft pull request that reworks how deposits are tracked. Users of the system will\\nnot notice any difference, but it is a necessary change needed to prepare the way for\\ndecentralizing the governance of Cardano.\\n\\nFinally, we continued to address technical debt. In particular, we continued to make progress on\\nbringing coherency and consistency to the code base with a common naming convention, and\\nimproving some error messages.\\n\\n## Lower level summary\\n\\n- We have a pull request up for our new versioned CBOR serialization.\\n  When we encounter a problem with our deserializers, it can be very difficult to implement a fix.\\n  It is difficult because we can only fix such issues during a hard fork, and leading up to the\\n  hard fork we must maintain two serializations for the same type in order to not cause unintended\\n  network splitting (the problematic version must be used before the hard fork,\\n  and the fixed version is used afterwards).\\n  This can be especially tricky with the `FromCBOR` typeclass, since it is not always easy to\\n  search for where all the problematic uses are located.\\n  The new versioned CBOR serialization allows us to gracefully handle this transition.\\n  See [[pull-3138]].\\n- We proposed a CIP for backwards compatibility of the transaction serialization schemes.\\n  See [[pull-372]].\\n- We have draft for the new deposit tracking.\\n  This draft is not as memory efficient as the final version will be,\\n  but it is a sufficient proof of concept that we can write property tests against, ensuring\\n  that we have not changed the semantics.\\n  We will optimize after we are sure of the correctness.\\n  See [[pull-3127]].\\n- We now provide better support for debugging failed Plutus scripts in an important helper\\n  function, named `evaluateTransactionExecutionUnits`.\\n  In particular, it now returns all the information needed to rerun the script with exactly the\\n  same arguments.

The next steps are:\\n\\n- Improve error handling and command generation.\\n- Add coverage testing to check that we are not failing to cover interesting\\n  test cases.\\n\\nThe [monadic cursor API](https://github.com/input-output-hk/lmdb-simple/pull/1)\\nwent through its first review round.

This will involve adding boilerplate code in consensus to make up for\\n  the removal of the `cborg`-based interface.\\n\\n## LSM tree implementation\\n\\nWe worked on the [LSM tree\\nprototype](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4121). In\\nparticular, we focused on tuning the LSM tree design to the different workloads\\nthat consensus has (eg syncing, normal node operation, etc).\\n\\n### Benchmarking the CSJ prototype\\n\\nWork on improving the chain-sync jumping performance is ongoing. In particular\\nwe compared the performance of different jump intervals, which, somewhat\\nsurprisingly, do not make a significant difference. In particular, we are seeing\\nperiodic \\"plateaus\\" where the chain-sync tip does not progress, but they are\\nmuch longer for the prototype. Our hypothesis is that this seem to be due to a\\ncombination of the garbage collector (GC) pauses, and the actual time it takes\\nthe non-dynamo chain-sync peers to jump to the tip of the slot of the dynamo\\nfragment.\\n\\nIn the coming weeks we will try to shorten these plateaus via a combination of\\ntweaking GC options and less synchronisation in the CSJ governor.\\n\\nThe following plot shows the performance of the chain-sync jumping prototype\\nusing different jumping intervals. It compares the syncing progress by plotting\\nthe slots of adopted blocks against time. The baseline is still faster, however\\nit is worth noting that the current prototype already achieves a significant\\nspeedup when compared to the naive approach of simply running full chain-sync\\nwith all peers.\\n\\n![](/images/consensus/2022-11-02-csj-vs-baseline.svg)\\n\\nThe second plot shows the syncing progress sliced to a chosen ~5min interval,\\nand includes, in addition to the slots of adopted blocks, the slots of the tip\\nof the ChainSync fragment. This allows us to see how far ahead of the selected\\ntip the CS dynamo is, i.e. how much room we have for BlockFetch not to get\\nstalled.

Thanks to these tests we were able to uncover a bug in the\\nprototype. On the Genesis front, we benchmarked a different version of the\\nChainSync jumping prototype to try to improve its performance, but this did not\\nresult in any noticeable speedup.\\n\\n## High-level status report\\n\\n- Finish the UTxO HD prototype: on track.\\n  - We focused on increasing test coverage for the UTxO-HD prototype:\\n    - We started implementing Cadano-eras transition property-tests.\\n    - We started implementing state-machine property-tests for the mempool.\\n    - We merged the mempool rewrite.\\n    - We started working on state-machine tests for the backing store. This\\n      uncovered a bug in the range-read implementation of the LMDB backing\\n      store.\\n- Genesis: on track.\\n  - We benchmarked a version of the Genesis ChainSync Jumping prototype that\\n    spreads out the ChainSync updates over a longer period of time. This did not\\n    result in any noticeable speedup.\\n  - We investigated the overhead introduced by non-ChainSync components, but no\\n    conclusions could be drawn from the benchmarks we ran.\\n\\n## Workstreams\\n\\n### Finish the UTxO HD prototype\\n\\nWe focused on increasing test coverage for the UTxO HD prototype. We also merged\\nthe [mempool\\nrewrite](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4049).\\n\\n#### Era transition property tests\\n\\nWe started implementing [Cardano era transition property\\ntests](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4043),\\nwhich are needed for making sure that the ledger tables get updated in the\\nright way when we move from one era to the next. There are at the moment two\\nimportant transitions.\\n- Byron to Shelley: where all the UTxO is transferred from in-memory Byron\\n  state (which has no tables) to the ledger tables of the Shelley state.\\n- Shelley to Allegra: where the AVVM addresses must be deleted.\\n\\nWe have tests for the Byron to Shelley transitions. We are working on adding\\nthe remaining ones.\\n\\n#### Mempool state-machine tests\\n\\nWe started implementing [state-machine property tests for the\\nmempool](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4044).\\nThe mempool is currently tested via pure property tests, and use a ledger\\nstate without tables. With the introduction of UTxO HD, testing the concurrent\\nbehavior of the mempool became of crucial importance (eg now we have to\\nacquire locks to flush the backing store). In addition, we need to test a\\nledger state with tables. These needs led to the creation of a new set of\\nproperty tests. In particular we aim to run parallel state-machine tests that\\nexercise the mempool in a way similar to how the node would make use of it.\\n\\n#### Backing store property tests\\n\\nWe started working on [state-machine tests for the backing\\nstore](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4081) that UTxO\\nHD uses. The property tests uncovered errors in the range-reads implementation\\nof the LMDB backing store. To facilitate fixing this bug, we made\\n[changes](https://github.com/input-output-hk/lmdb-simple/pull/1) to the Haskell\\nLMDB bindings.\\n\\n### Benchmarking the CSJ prototype\\n\\nPrompted by previous benchmarks showing significant improvements in sync time by\\nusing more capabilities, we implemented a way to spread out the ChainSync\\nupdates over a larger period instead of firing them all at the same time. This\\ndidn\'t result in a noticeable speedup.\\n\\nWe also benchmarked the prototype with CSJ disabled (such that just the dynamo\\npeer is running ChainSync, but e.g. BlockFetch still sees all peers) to rule\\nout/confirm overhead by non-ChainSync (mainly BlockFetch) related components.\\nThis results in era-specific behavior (speed is like the prototype in Byron, but\\nlike the baseline in Shelley). This deserves a closer look in the future.\\n\\nThis diagram shows the respective syncing progress, starting at Genesis and\\ncontinuing a good part into Shelley (with the dashed line indicating the\\nByron-to-Shelley transition).\\n\\n - Red: baseline\\n - Green: CSJ prototype, 10 peers, jumps every 3000/f slots, jumps in clumps.\\n - Blue: like Green, jumps are spread out.\\n - Orange: variant with no jumping, to measure unrelated overhead.\\n\\n![](/images/happy-path-csj-prototype-bench-2.svg)"},{"id":"2022-10-14-hydra","metadata":{"permalink":"/cardano-updates/2022-10-14-hydra","editUrl":"https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2022-10-14-hydra.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-10-14-hydra.md","title":"Hydra Team Update","description":"High level summary","date":"2022-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 14, 2022","tags":[{"label":"hydra","permalink":"/cardano-updates/tags/hydra"}],"readingTime":1.26,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Nagel","title":"Hydra Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/ch1bo","imageURL":"https://github.com/ch1bo.png","key":"ch1bo"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Hydra Team Update","slug":"2022-10-14-hydra","authors":"ch1bo","tags":["hydra"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Consensus Team Update","permalink":"/cardano-updates/2022-10-18-consensus"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ledger Team Update","permalink":"/cardano-updates/2022-10-14-ledger"}},"content":"## High level summary\\n\\nThis week, the hydra team worked on implementing ADR18 to get backup & restore functionality of the `hydra-node` over the line.

This has been\\n one of db-sync main objectives for this period.

The prototype is slower than the baseline, however it is not the latest\\n  version of the prototype and the jump interval is very small.\\n- Work on integrating Conway has [stopped][nicks-comment-conway] since\\n  priorities have changed.\\n- We started work on benchmarking epoch-boundaries and epoch overhead\\n  [pr-4014][pr-4014]. To this end, we made use of a modified version of our\\n  `db-analyser` tool. We ran the new benchmarking setup using the Cardano\\n  mainnet chain, and we can see that block tick and application take\\n  substantially longer at epoch boundaries, although there are a couple of slots\\n  during an epoch in which these computations take more than normal. We notified\\n  the ledger team about these findings. We will use this modified version of\\n  `db-analyser` to investigate the epoch overhead.\\n\\n\\n# Workstreams\\n\\n## UTxO HD\\n\\n - Spent quite some time investigating the root cause of the degradation in\\n   performance observed in the benchmarks. We run the `make forge-stress`\\n   benchmarks locally in order to debug this behavior.\\n\\n    - Transaction batching doesn\'t make a notable difference in the outcome\\n      (considering we are using the in-memory backend).\\n\\n    - The mempool batching implementation required asynchronous transaction\\n      validation which is a violation of the `LocalTxSubmission` protocol\\n      contract and therefore if we continued on that route, the impact would\\n      have been quite big.\\n\\n    - The STM logic we implemented by using a `TMVar` for the mempool internal\\n      state was buggy and under certain circumstances it seemed to lock.\\n      Reverting the mempool internal state to be stored in a `TVar` seems to\\n      solve this problem.\\n\\n    - The results we get after this change look almost identical to the ones\\n      from the baseline.\\n\\n  - [The anti-diff prototype (PR\\n    #3997)](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3997) has\\n    been reviewed and is close to being merged.\\n\\n    - A follow-up issue ([issue\\n      #4010](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4010))\\n      to integrate the anti-diff prototype in the various `consensus` packages\\n      was created. A first version of the integration exists, and all tests\\n      pass. A next step is to get some indication of the \\"real\\" performance gain\\n      by profiling `db-analyser` (or `cardano-node`).\\n\\n## Genesis\\n\\n - Final draft of the Genesis implementation specification, now up for review.\\n\\n - Local benchmark setup for parameter tuning via the happy path ChainSync\\n   Jumping (CSJ) prototype ([Issue 3987][issue-3987]).\\n\\n    - Context: Our Genesis design requires us to check in with a large (~20)\\n      number of servers periodically while syncing. These servers are offered\\n      jump requests via the ChainSync protocol (hence the name), which they can\\n      accept or decline. If a peer declines, the Genesis rule allows us to\\n      determine whether a node actually has a better chain.\\n\\n    - The \\"happy path\\" is when no peer declines a jump. We want this to have\\n      close to no overhead compared to status quo, i.e. syncing without Genesis.\\n\\n    - We implemented a prototype for this happy path, and are now starting to\\n      test in various configurations (number of peers, latency, bandwidth) to\\n      tune the performance of ChainSync jumping, i.e. how complicated our logic\\n      of choosing when to jump needs to be.\\n\\n    **Example:**\\n\\n     - Simulated connection: 50 MBit/s, 50ms latency\\n\\n     - Jump interval: 3000 slots (on the low end, could be increased to up to\\n       `3k/f`)\\n\\n     - Red: baseline (1.35.3), one peer in topology file\\n\\n     - Blue: Preliminary version of our prototype, with 10 peers.\\n\\n    ![](/images/happy-path-csj-prototype-prelim.svg)\\n\\n    It is slower by about ~30%, but it is not the latest version of the\\n    prototype, and the jump interval is very small, making CSJ more of a\\n    bottleneck.\\n\\n## Technical debt\\n\\n- Fix flakiness in ChainDB QSM tests ([PR 3990](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3990)).\\n\\n[issue-3987]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3987\\n[nicks-comment-conway]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3971#issuecomment-1252524031\\n[pr-4014]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4014"},{"id":"2022-09-19-db-sync","metadata":{"permalink":"/cardano-updates/2022-09-19-db-sync","editUrl":"https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2022-09-19-db-sync.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-19-db-sync.md","title":"DB Sync Team Update","description":"DBSync Update","date":"2022-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 19, 2022","tags":[{"label":"db-sync","permalink":"/cardano-updates/tags/db-sync"}],"readingTime":1.525,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Kostas Dermentzis","title":"Cardano DB-Sync Software Engineer","url":"https://github.com/kderme","imageURL":"https://github.com/kderme.png","key":"kderme"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"DB Sync Team Update","slug":"2022-09-19-db-sync","authors":"kderme","tags":["db-sync"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Consensus Team Update","permalink":"/cardano-updates/2022-09-20-consensus"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ledger Team Update","permalink":"/cardano-updates/2022-09-16-ledger"}},"content":"## DBSync Update\\n\\n### New Tag\\nWe created a new db-sync tag 13.0.5 which addresses shortcomings of the last\\nrelease 13.0.4.

However, some\\n  functionalities remain untested, e.g., reads of ranges of keys. As such, we\\n  have implemented `quickcheck-state-machine` tests that exercise backing stores\\n  directly. The tests are reusable for different backing store implementations\\n  because the tests are implementation-agnostic: Any backing store that conforms\\n  to the backing store interface can be plugged into the tests. Work is still\\n  ongoing to label/monitor the tests, such that we can verify that interesting\\n  cases are being tested. Furthermore, a possible bug has been identified in the\\n  LMDB backing store with respect to range reads, though the bug has not been\\n  resolved yet.\\n- [Issue #3946][issue-3946], [branch][branch-4199], [PR #3882][pull-3882]: The\\n  \\"anti-diff\\" prototype proposes an alternative approach to keeping track of\\n  sequences (more specifically, `FingerTree`s) of diffs. These diff sequences\\n  are a component of the in-memory parts of the ledger state in UTxO-HD. Since\\n  the consensus code often requires the cumulative diff of a sequence of diffs,\\n  the current implementation \\"caches\\" cumulative diffs of each subtree in the\\n  diff sequence. This caching allows relatively fast reconstruction of the total\\n  cumulative diff, but this caching proved to incur a non-negligible cost: when\\n  we manipulate diff sequences through splits and appends, we force re-computing\\n  a logarithmic number of caches. This is problematic, since we often split and\\n  append in consensus: we split when we flush diffs to a backing store or when\\n  we roll back blocks, and we append when pushing blocks. The new approach\\n  should reduce the overhead of this caching.\\n\\n  We implemented micro-benchmarks for the \\"anti-diff\\" prototype: we\\n  first generate a sequence of commands (`Forward`, `Push`, `Flush`, or\\n  `Rollback`) through a simulation, after which we measure the performance of\\n  applying the commands to a diff sequence. In this context, `Forward` means\\n  forwarding of values through a diff, whereas `Rollback` means switching to\\n  a different fork by rolling back diffs/blocks and pushing new ones.\\n  Moreover, we compare the performance for the two implementations: the\\n  \\"legacy\\" approach, and the anti-diff approach.\\n\\n  Some preliminary results were positive, but we needed to revisit the\\n  benchmark\'s configuration to obtain more definitive results. After a\\n  discussion with @dcoutts and the consensus team about this configuration\\n  (e.g., number of commands generated, choice of the security parameter `k`),\\n  the benchmarks should now be closer to the realistic setting. The following\\n  configuration specifies the default configuration that is used in the\\n  benchmarking code:\\n  * Number of commands generated: `10_000`\\n  * Security parameter `k`: `2160`\\n  * Number of initial backing values: `100`\\n  * Number of key-value pairs deleted by a push: `50`\\n  * Number of key-value pairs inserted by a push: `50`\\n  * Number of key-value pairs forwarded by a forward: `50`\\n  * Probability of a large (in the range `[1000, 2000]`) rollback: `0.05`\\n  * Probability of a small (in the range `[1, 10]`) rollback: `0.95`\\n  * Order of commands:\\n    * An equal number of forward and pushes.\\n    * `1` flush every `10` pushes.\\n    * `1` rollback every `100` pushes\\n\\n  Moreover, we run four benchmark scenarios:\\n  * Default configuration\\n  * Without rollbacks\\n  * With only small rollbacks\\n  * Without rollbacks, larger flushes (`1` flush every `100` pushes)\\n\\n  ### How to read results\\n\\n  Note: this section uses documentation from the\\n  [tasty-bench](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-bench) package to\\n  explain how to read the results of running our benchmarks.\\n\\n  Running a benchmark scenario gives us the following (curated) output:\\n  ```text\\n  ...\\n  AntiDiff:                               OK (18.27s)\\n    2.527 s \xb1  47 ms, 2.1 GB allocated, 544 MB copied, 2.2 GB peak memory, 0.23x\\n  LegacyDiff:                             OK (32.73s)\\n    10.829 s \xb1 148 ms, 6.8 GB allocated, 2.3 GB copied, 2.2 GB peak memory\\n  ...\\n  ```\\n\\n  The output says that the first benchmark, which exercises the anti-diff\\n  prototype, was repeatedly executed for `18.27` seconds (wall-clock time),\\n  its predicted mean CPU time was `2.527` seconds and means of individual\\n  samples do not often diverge from it further than `\xb1 47` milliseconds\\n  (double standard deviation). We also configure the RTS to collect GC\\n  statistics, which enables `tasty-bench` to estimate and report memory usage.\\n  This data is reported as per `RTSStats` fields: `allocated_bytes`,\\n  `copied_bytes` and `max_mem_in_use_bytes`. So, the output of the first\\n  benchmark says that a total of `2.1 GB` of memory was allocated, that a\\n  total of `544 MB` of memory were copied, and that the peak memory in usage\\n  was `2.2 GB`. We read the output for the second benchmark in the same way.\\n\\n  Furthermore, the benchmark compares the mean CPU times for\\n  both the anti-diff and legacy approaches: In this case, the mean CPU time\\n  for the anti-diff approach is `~0.23x` the mean CPU time for the legacy\\n  approach. Conversely, the mean CPU time for the legacy approach is\\n  `1 / 0.23 ~= 4.35x` the mean CPU time for the anti-diff approach. We will\\n  call `0.23x` the *improvement factor*. We will call `4.35x` the *speedup*.\\n\\n  Note that these improvement factors (and reported results) are subject to\\n  noise, randomness, the specific configuration parameters, and the whims\\n  of statistics. Data reported by `tasty-bench` is only of indicative and\\n  comparative significance.\\n\\n  ### Results\\n\\n  For each of the 4 scenarios, we list the results of running the anti-diff and\\n  legacy approaches 5 times. We run the benchmarks 5 times to get an indication\\n  of whether the results are similar across multiple runs. Furthermore, we\\n  calculate the accompanying *ranges* (if applicable) of improvement factors and\\n  speedups.\\n\\n  Note also the decrease in total bytes allocated and total bytes copied for\\n  the anti-diff approach compared to the legacy approach.\\n\\n  #### Default configuration\\n\\n  |Name|Mean CPU time|2*Stdev (CPU time)|Total bytes allocated|Total bytes copied|Peak memory|\\n  |-|-|-|-|-|-|\\n  |Run 1: AntiDiff|2.533 s (0.23x)|4.7 ms|2.1 GB|557 MB|2.4 GB|\\n  |Run 1: LegacyDiff|10.792 s|162 ms|6.8 GB|2.3 GB|2.4 GB|\\n  |Run 2: AntiDiff|2.508 s (0.23x)|245 ms|2.1 GB|515 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 2: LegacyDiff|10.850 s| 30 ms|6.9 GB|2.3 GB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 3: AntiDiff|2.562 s (0.23x)|5.0 ms|2.1 GB|552 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 3: LegacyDiff|10.993 s|149 ms|6.9 GB|2.3 GB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 4: AntiDiff|2.168 s (0.22x)|5.3 ms|1.8 GB|434 MB|2.0 GB|\\n  |Run 4: LegacyDiff|9.976 s| 39 ms|6.3 GB|2.0 GB|2.0 GB|\\n  |Run 5: AntiDiff|2.527 s (0.23x)| 47 ms|2.1 GB|544 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 5: LegacyDiff|10.829 s|148 ms|6.8 GB|2.3 GB|2.2 GB|\\n\\n  * Improvement factor: `[0.22, 0.23]`\\n  * Speedup : `[1 / 0.23 ~= 4.35, 1 / 0.22 ~= 4.55]`\\n\\n  #### No rollbacks\\n\\n  |Name|Mean CPU time|2*Stdev (CPU time)|Total bytes allocated|Total bytes copied|Peak memory|\\n  |-|-|-|-|-|-|\\n  |Run 1: AntiDiff|1.638 s (0.19x)| 36 ms|1.4 GB|181 MB|2.4 GB|\\n  |Run 1: LegacyDiff|8.656 s|207 ms|5.7 GB|1.5 GB|2.4 GB|\\n  |Run 2: AntiDiff|1.638 s (0.19x)| 75 ms|1.4 GB|181 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 2: LegacyDiff|8.654 s|322 ms|5.7 GB|1.5 GB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 3: AntiDiff|1.663 s (0.19x)| 74 ms|1.4 GB|181 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 3: LegacyDiff|8.799 s|216 ms|5.7 GB|1.5 GB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 4: AntiDiff|1.645 s (0.19x)| 51 ms|1.4 GB|181 MB|2.0 GB|\\n  |Run 4: LegacyDiff|8.732 s|261 ms|5.7 GB|1.5 GB|2.0 GB|\\n  |Run 5: AntiDiff|1.639 s (0.19x)| 19 ms|1.4 GB|181 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 5: LegacyDiff|8.653 s|234 ms|5.7 GB|1.5 GB|2.2 GB|\\n\\n  * Improvement factor: `0.19`\\n  * Speedup : `1 / 0.19 ~= 5.25`\\n\\n\\n  #### Only small rollbacks\\n\\n  |Name|Mean CPU time|2*Stdev (CPU time)|Total bytes allocated|Total bytes copied|Peak memory|\\n  |-|-|-|-|-|-|\\n  |Run 1: AntiDiff|1.833 s (0.18x)| 36 ms|1.5 GB|185 MB|2.4 GB|\\n  |Run 1: LegacyDiff|10.362 s|867 ms|5.8 GB|1.6 GB|2.4 GB|\\n  |Run 2: AntiDiff|1.696 s (0.19x)| 30 ms|1.5 GB|185 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 2: LegacyDiff|8.822 s|106 ms|5.8 GB|1.5 GB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 3: AntiDiff|1.702 s (0.19x)| 44 ms|1.5 GB|186 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 3: LegacyDiff|8.906 s|147 ms|5.8 GB|1.5 GB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 4: AntiDiff|1.701 s (0.19x)| 47 ms|1.5 GB|185 MB|2.0 GB|\\n  |Run 4: LegacyDiff|8.949 s|197 ms|5.8 GB|1.5 GB|2.0 GB|\\n  |Run 5: AntiDiff|1.677 s (0.19x)| 55 ms|1.5 GB|186 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 5: LegacyDiff|8.856 s|177 ms|5.8 GB|1.5 GB|2.2 GB|\\n\\n  * Improvement factor: `[0.18, 0.19]`\\n  * Speedup : `[1 / 0.19 ~= 5.25, 1 / 0.18 ~= 5.55]`\\n\\n  #### No rollbacks, larger flushes (every 100 pushes)\\n\\n  |Name|Mean CPU time|2*Stdev (CPU time)|Total bytes allocated|Total bytes copied|Peak memory|\\n  |-|-|-|-|-|-|\\n  |Run 1: AntiDiff|1.643 s (0.25x)| 21 ms|1.5 GB|196 MB|2.4 GB|\\n  |Run 1: LegacyDiff|6.591 s|351 ms|4.0 GB|1.4 GB|2.4 GB|\\n  |Run 2: AntiDiff|1.616 s (0.25x)| 47 ms|1.5 GB|196 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 2: LegacyDiff|6.520 s|232 ms|4.0 GB|1.4 GB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 3: AntiDiff|1.640 s (0.25x)| 34 ms|1.5 GB|196 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 3: LegacyDiff|6.540 s|150 ms|4.0 GB|1.4 GB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 4: AntiDiff|1.635 s (0.25x)| 76 ms|1.5 GB|196 MB|2.0 GB|\\n  |Run 4: LegacyDiff|6.589 s|131 ms|4.0 GB|1.4 GB|2.0 GB|\\n  |Run 5: AntiDiff|1.628 s (0.25x)| 19 ms|1.5 GB|196 MB|2.2 GB|\\n  |Run 5: LegacyDiff|6.490 s|5.9 ms|4.0 GB|1.4 GB|2.2 GB|\\n\\n  * Improvement factor: `0.25`\\n  * Speedup : `1 / 0.25 ~= 4`\\n\\n### Genesis\\n\\n - We elaborated a draft of the specification of the Genesis implementation and\\n   the ChainSync Jumping optimization. In particular, this includes a proof\\n   sketch that the latter preserves liveness and safety in all cases ([Issue\\n   3964][issue-3964]).\\n      - @nfrisby\'s main realization during this sprint was that he had been\\n        focusing so far on the case where the selected chain is an extension of\\n        the intersection of our peers\' ChainSync candidates.\\n      - This is the main case, ie an \\"absorbing\\" state, but it\'s not the only\\n        case.\\n      - The new proof sketch begins by case splitting on that predicate, and\\n        that made the sketch quite a bit easier to follow.\\n - We continued working on the \\"happy path\\" `ChainSync` Jumping prototype ([Issue\\n   3960][issue-3960]).\\n\\n### Technical debt\\n\\n - We started working on the issues required to re-enable nightly CI runs..\\n   Nightly CI runs have far more lax time constraints, which gives the option to\\n   run significantly more property tests than in our regular CI. To this end, we\\n   merged a PR to easily adapt the number of tests globally ([PR\\n   #3947][pull-3947]).\\n\\n[issue-3954]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3954\\n[branch-3954]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/tree/jdral/3954-backingstore-property-tests\\n[issue-3946]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3946\\n[branch-4199]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/tree/jdral/CAD-4199-prototype-anti-diffs\\n[pull-3882]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3882\\n[pull-3947]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3947\\n[issue-3960]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3960\\n[issue-3962]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3962\\n[issue-3964]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3964\\n[pull-3971]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3971\\n[issue-3976]: https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3976"},{"id":"2022-08-12-network","metadata":{"permalink":"/cardano-updates/2022-08-12-network","editUrl":"https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-updates/tree/main/blog/2022-08-12-network.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-12-network.md","title":"Network Team Update","description":"The networking team took an active part in the project iteration (PI) planning","date":"2022-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 12, 2022","tags":[{"label":"network","permalink":"/cardano-updates/tags/network"}],"readingTime":0.88,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Szamotulski","title":"Network Team Lead","url":"https://github.com/coot","imageURL":"https://github.com/coot.png","key":"coot"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Network Team Update","slug":"2022-08-12-network","authors":"coot","tags":["network"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Consensus Team Update","permalink":"/cardano-updates/2022-08-31-consensus"}},"content":"```mdx-code-block\\nimport  ReactPlayer from \'react-player\'\\n```\\n\\n\\nThe networking team took an active part in the project iteration (PI) planning\\nsession, see cardano-node [backlog](https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/39) for detailed\\noutcomes.\\n\\n\\n* We started working on a detailed design / implementation plan for gossip.\\n\\n* We merged [input-output-hk/ouroboros-network#3859](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3859) which\\n  sets the ouroboros-network repository for the single relay release.\\n\\n* We identified a bug in the network simulator, which is fixed in the\\n  [input-output-hk/ouroboros-network#3852](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3852).\\n  The above PR was reviewed.\\n\\n* We set the tracing configuration for nodes which we deploy and fixed and\\n  identified some deployment hiccups.
