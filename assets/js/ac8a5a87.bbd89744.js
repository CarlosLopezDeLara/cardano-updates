We have made strides here and have managed to improve the interface of transaction construction and validation.\\n- General documentation updates and improvements\\n- Addition of tx-mempool command which allows users to:\\n  - Query the node about the current mempool\'s capacity and sizes\\n  - Request the next transaction from the mempool\'s current list\\n  - Query if a particular transaction exists in the mempool\\n-  Initial refactoring of cardano-testnet\\n\\nNext quarter\\n\\n- cardano-api\\n  - Working with Konstantinos and his team to make cardano-api better for dapp developers - we have a google doc for this, I can send it to you privately.\\n- cardano-testnet\\n  - Working with Marc Fontaine to create an easy to use executable to deploy testnets locally - https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/issues/4598\\n- Serenity\\n  - Continued refactoring of cardano-api and cardano-cli, with the particular focus on extracting re-usable components of cardano-cli and moving them to cardano-api. This is harder to define but will manifest in stuff moving from cardano-cli to cardano-api and is tied in to the cardano-api work specified above.\\n- General bug fixing and smaller feature requests for the api/cli that are always coming in. Robert is primarily handling this at the moment as he is relatively new."}]}')}}]);
