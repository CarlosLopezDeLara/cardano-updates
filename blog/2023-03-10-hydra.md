## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team addressed issues with committing complex UTxOs into a
Hydra Head, prepared the `hydra-node` to be run on mainnet (soon) and improved
the test suite of the `hydra-plutus` scripts. The specification is constantly
getting improved upon reviewer feedback on overleaf - this week the graphical
notation was refined to be more transaction-focused.

## What did the team achieve this week

-   Clarified &ldquo;bug&rdquo; of committing UTxOs with reference scripts to a Hydra head [#737](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/737)
-   Prepare usage of `hydra-node` on mainnet by updating command line options [#715](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/715)
-   Improved our mutation test suite to all expected errors [#705](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/705)
-   Re-opened our persistent hydraw demo head on `preprod` using version `0.9.0`
-   Updated on-chain graphs to be more transaction-focused in the specification

## What are the goals of next week

-   Complete mainnet compatibility feature
-   Prepare the Hydra workshop
-   Address all todoâ€™s in the Hydra specification
-   Unblock the auctions project with &ldquo;commit from script&rdquo; a solution
