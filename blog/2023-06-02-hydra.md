## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team has put their effort on finding solutions on many
different problems, such as our broken head on mainnet
[#897](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/897), our fragile monthly
report publications on the website and implementing &ldquo;Option A&rdquo; for
external commits [#215](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/215).
Although most of these items are still open, huge progress has been made. To
accelerate the investigation, they improved their logging to give more precise
errors when a transition requirement fails, and to reduce duplication on effets
logged content. Last but not least, the team is exploring formal methods and
attended a workshop on formalizing cryptographic protocols in Agda.


## What did the team achieve this week

-   Continued investigating broken head and opened an issue to keep track [#897](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/897).
    
    As part of this issue, improvements were made to the node logs:

    +   Give a precise error when a transition requirement fails [#895](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/895).

    +   Reduce duplication for effects logged content by using sequential eventId and effectId pair  [#896](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/896).

-   Fixed references in the hydra specification [#893](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/893).

-   Attended a workshop on formal methods and crypto in Agda.

## What are the goals of next week

-   Investigate and re-open our team-internal head on mainnet.
-   Improve and provide regular benchmarks for Hydra [#186](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/186).
-   Complete journey for external commits implementing &ldquo;Option A&rdquo; and start implementing &ldquo;Option B&rdquo; [#215](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/215).
-   Authenticate network messages [#727](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/727).
-   Add hydra as tool to developr platform [#872](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/872).
-   Fix monthly report publication on docs website.
