## High-level overview of [sprint 41][sprint-41]
_24th July - 6th August 2023_

We started the implementation of __bootstrap peers__.  Bootstrap peers are designed
to provide a safety guarantee for nodes joining the network while still taking
advantage of the distributed network for nodes that are synced.  This will be
an intermediate step before Genesis which will allow for further distribute the
system.  The bootstrap peers will be run by some trusted partners like CF,
Emurgo or IOG.   They are primarily designed for leaf nodes (e.g. full node
wallets), which often end up syncing and require access to the honest chain. See
[ouroboros-network#4615] for a more detailed implementation plan.

## Other contributions

We started to use `nothunks` library to discover if we have any unevaluated
thunks which can lead to memory leaks [ouroboros-network#4633].  We found
a small one in the peer metric component of the P2P networking stack.  Fixing
it put us on a small detour of fixing the API of the [`strict-checked-vars`]
package: [cardano-base#431], [cardano-base#432], as well as adding `NFData`
instance to [`io-classes`][io-classes#110].  We also improved `nothunks`
library to make debugging easier and we provided a `NoThunks` instance for
`ThreadId` which we will need in the future (see [nothunks#33]).

We released a new version of `io-classes` (version `1.2.0.0`) and related
packages to [Hackage][io-classes-1.2.0.0].

We addressed all review comments on the eclipse evasion PR which introduces big
ledger peers, [ouroboros-network#3886].

We fixed how `SIGHUP` signal handlers are registered, so it's not possible to
shutdown a node which was starting while trying to update network topology,
see [cardano-node#5421].

I didn't mention that in the previous update, so here it goes: in the previous
sprint we released [`ouroboros-network-0.8.2.0`] and
[`ouroboros-network-framework-0.7.0.0`].
