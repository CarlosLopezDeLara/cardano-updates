## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team completed the Hydra specification with a section about
rollbacks and updated graphs
([#448](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/448)). In a next step,
the specification will be made more approachable and an open standard. They
improved their `hydra-cluster` tool to launch a local `--devnet` sandbox
environment and continued aligning the `hydra-plutus` scripts with the
specification by hardening the checks on `close` and `contest` transactions.

## What did the team achieve this week

- Completed the specification with a section about rollbacks and updated graphs
    [#448](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/448), with a follow-up on making it more approachable and an open standard.
- Continued spec review with internal auditor and incorporated changes.
- Talked to TxPipe about how Demeter and Hydra could work together
- The `hydra-cluster` executable can be used to launch a local `--devnet` sandbox environment.
- Reproduced the “head being stuck on network outage” bug
    - relates to what liveness guarantees we can / want to give on the protocol level and needs to be discussed.
- Progressed with higher velocity by addressing more and more gaps [#677](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/677)

## What are the goals of next week

- Upstream our JSON instances to the ledger
- Close all transaction security related on-chain gaps
- Ideally release 0.9.0 with updated scripts
- Groom & plan (or not) protocol changes yielded from specification discussions -> updated roadmap
