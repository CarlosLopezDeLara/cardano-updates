## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team held their Monthly review meeting and drafted the
report which likely is published next week. They put the spec into the
repository and website, addressed a user issue and fixed the TUI peer list.
Furthermore, they updated dependencies, conducted a Twitter space on Auctions
use cases, covered the rollback bug with tests and implemented a solution.
Looking ahead, their goals for next week include releasing 0.10.0, implementing
timed transactions support, writing a Query API ADR, and grooming work items
like off-chain benchmarks.
