## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team worked on several fronts, including fixing state
machine continuity on-chain, discussing voting project solutions, exploring
adding Hydra support to kupo, and improving API navigation with a sidebar. The
team also updated dependencies and fixed issues in their test suites. Moving
forward, the team plans to hold the next monthly review meeting, address a user
issue, prepare for the 0.10.0 release, and work on a dirt road fix for the
rollbacks issue with proper test coverage.

## What did the team achieve this week

-   Fixed scripts to enforce state machine continuity on-chain [#777](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/777).
-   Took part in a twitter space on [&ldquo;Scaling Cardano&rdquo;](https://twitter.com/thepizzaknight_/status/1647833904282320896).
-   Joined a CBIA meeting to discuss Cardano network protocols & how to specify them.
-   Discussed potential solutions of ensuring vote uniqueness in the voting project.
-   Updated dependencies to match `cardano-node` master to prepare for upcoming releases and hard-forks
-   Explored adding Hydra [support to kupo](https://github.com/CardanoSolutions/kupo/pull/117), a lightweight Cardano chain indexer - some more work required.
-   Improved navigation of the API Reference with a sidebar, see [unstable API version](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/unstable/api-reference/).
-   Fixed two things in our test suites (random port conflicts and an arithmetic underflow in smoke test)

## What are the goals of next week

-   Monthly review meeting (join via [Discord](https://discord.gg/inputoutput?event=1097863746216538194) or [AddEvent](https://www.addevent.com/event/ck16794110)) & report
-   Dirt road fix for rollbacks [#784](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/784) properly covered by a test.
-   Groom and ideally address user issue [#823](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/823).
-   Put the spec into the repo [#693](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/693) and prepare release 0.10.0.
