## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team kicked off a new project together with Catalyst, the Cardano Foundation and researchers from IO: a proof of concept for voting on Hydra. The concluded work on validating the Head protocol using model-based testing and formulated next steps, fixed the transaction cost benchmark reporting on [the website](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/benchmarks/transaction-cost/) and reduced the cost for commit transactions by ~30% with the help of reference scripts.

The year is coming to an end and velocity will slow down a bit while the team focuses on wrapping up loose ends. The updates here will pause until January 2023.

## What did the team achieve this week

- Kicked-off Hydra Voting project with Catalyst, CF, and IO Research.
- Reduce commit transaction costs by ~30% with reference scripts.
- Prepared an RFP for external audit of the Hydra Head solution.
- Fixed transaction cost benchmarks for abort tx [#631](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/631).
- Recorded decision to use model-based testing ([ADR22](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/adr/22/)) and improved Model [documentation](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/haddock/hydra-node/tests/Hydra-Model.html).
    - Concluding the first increment on &ldquo;Validate coordinated Head protocol&rdquo; [#194](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/194).
    - Formulated next step / follow-up on testing the Soundness property of our protocol [#656](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/656).
- Switched to using nix flakes for development setup and CI build [#646](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/646).

# What are the goals of next week

- Push [ADR21](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/7e532bd1c8a840a8155cf4b0858b982308dfc3f0/docs/adr/CloseTx-validity-bounds-and-deadline-calculation-DoS.md) & tx validity gap over the finish line (smoke tests missing).
- Integrate the `hydra-tutorial`.
- Have a LaTeX write-up of the HeadV1 (Coordinated Hydra Head) spec.
- Close & recap on the year with another monthly report (+ blog post).
