## High level summary

The DBSync team is preparing a release which introduces schema simplifications, removes indexes,
unique and foreign keys. It also provides a way to fix older values and migrates without the need to
resync from genesis.

## Lower level summary

### Schema simplifications

Indexes, Unique and Foreign keys are removed in order to speedup syncing
[#1295](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/pull/1295)
The same pr also introduces a different way to rollback, which doesn't rely on foreign keys and
indexes.

### Performance

The DBSync team ran a big number of benchmarks and investigated ways to speedup syncing. A
conservative number of these will be included in the next release and the rest can be found in
[performance view](https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/52/views/7).

### Migrations and resyncing

The next release will be 13.1.0, it will enable a migration without the need to resync. It will also
introduce a procedure that fixes bytes values of Datum and RedeemerData in existing databases
[#1294](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/pull/1294)

### Release

The release has been mostly cherry-picked from master
[#1294](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/pull/1294) and its scope can be seen
