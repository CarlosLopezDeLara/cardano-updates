## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team published together with Obsidian Systems a light paper
on our "Hydra for Payments" project ([Link](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/11/10/hydra-for-payments-introducing-developer-tooling-to-unlock-micropayments-on-cardano/)). They have created a draft scope RFP for the external audit and worked with the internal audit team to clear up the specification. From the development side, they have fixed a bug with chain-following when using persistence and improved logs for better observability of `hydra-node` processes.
