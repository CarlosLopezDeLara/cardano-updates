## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team published the monthly report for March, creating
separate links for different versions of documentation, and clarifying potential
solutions for the Rollbacks bug. The team also discussed Query API requests for
the Hydra Voting project and met with community members to answer questions
about Hydra. Moving forward, the team plans to integrate the specification into
the repository, implement a short-term fix for the Rollbacks issue, draft a
Query API ADR, and update Hydraw to maintain state locally.
