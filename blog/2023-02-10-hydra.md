## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team closed several gaps to align the Hydra scripts
implementation further with the specification. This also resulted in a slight
improvement on Hydra script size and costs. They consequently analysed the
asymptotic complexity of collect and fanout and how they relate. Also plutus-tx
profiling toolchain was evaluated and set up for future improvements on Hydra
on-chain performance. In discussions with researchers and internal auditors,
they also uncovered next steps on further securing the Head protocl using a
"full" minting policy.

## What did the team achieve this week

-   Closed several gaps to align script implementation with specification [#452](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/452)
    -   Allow contest only once [#680](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/680)
    -   Optimization through head output at index 0 [#700](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/700)
    -   Value is preserved [#702](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/702) + optimized exact value equality [#709](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/709)
-   Analysed asymptotic complexity of some of our scripts and set up profiling toolchain to [#721](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/721)

-   Fixed our tooling around the Haskell language server
-   Discussed full minting policy with researchers
-   Started grooming “what we need for mainnet” on [this](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/713) idea ticket and [milestone](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/milestone/8)

## What are the goals of next week

-   Implement full minting policy
-   All remaining protocol discrepancies are implemented or groomed as individual features
-   Ideally release 0.9.0 with updated scripts
-   Discuss what we need for mainnet (milestone planning)
-   Redraw transaction graphs for specification (upon feedback)
