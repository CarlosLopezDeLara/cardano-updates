## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team wrote and published the monthly report for June,
implemented the end-to-end functionality for external commits, and tested it on
the preview environment. They also listed Hydra as a tool on the Cardano
developer portal, providing more visibility for the project. The team clarified
the path forward for L2 protocol improvements and explored an alternative CI
approach using cabal instead of nix. Additionally, they released version 0.11.0,
marking another milestone in the project&rsquo;s development.
