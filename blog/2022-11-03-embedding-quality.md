## Embedding Quality work-stream

What did we progressed on until now:
* Cardano System Tests fully open to public (tools, tests, results) 
  See [cardano-node-tests webpage](https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-node-tests).
* Defined an [user-facing-functionality template](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/user-facing-feature.md) that is used to the cardano-cli team 
  * this includes acceptance criteria & user stories, and definition of done
* We are in the process of running the cardano-node-tests at commit & PR level in cardano-node (we are affected by the Cicero migration right now but we did most of the work already)
* We started to apply a [labelling convention](https://input-output.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/QA/pages/3647111431/GitHub+Repo+Labeling+Convention) on [cardano-node issues](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/issues) that will be used to generate some visual dashboards with some metrics [TBD]
* Ziyand Liu started an [End-to-End Development and Testing Process for Plutus Features](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wR3nEAfx1qgb3_mYYMgRPEkmDZhu7rH8m4OHw82bQf4/edit)
