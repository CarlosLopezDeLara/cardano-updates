## High-level summary

During this week, the Hydra team achieved significant progress in various areas.
They conducted the monthly review meeting for July, which continously ensures
transparent communication and project evaluation. The team migrated the core
logic of the node to an event-sourced architecture and incremental writes of
events to persistence, enhancing the project&rsquo;s performance and maintainability.
Furthermore, the team added the ability to read protocol parameters via the API
and fixed the CI workflows to support pull requests from forks of external
contributors, streamlining the development process for community involvement.
