## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team has been focusing on the write-up of the Hydra HeadV1
specification. Of which a first version has been aggregated and is currently
under review. They aligned the on-chain scripts of reimbursing funds on abort
like defined in the specification, improved the mutation test framework to have
more control when testing plutus scripts. The added HeadId in the API and the
TUI example client make `hydra-node` easier to use and a first experiment of a
Hydra Head explorer was showing the utility of this - see what Heads exist on
the `preview` network [here](http://explorer.hydra.family).

## What did the team achieve this week

-   HeadId to API and display in the TUI [#678](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/678)
-   Experiment of creating a hydra explorer, first result hosted [here](http://explorer.hydra.family)
-   Improved mutation framework allowing to fail for the right reason [#679](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/679)
-   Correctly reimburse funds in abort (matching the spec) [#670](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/670)
-   Finished a first write-up of the Hydra HeadV1 spec: [Read it on overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/bbqzmptcxryj) ([Communication channels](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/master/SUPPORT.md) for feedback)

## What are the goals of next week

-   Monthly review meeting with a broader audience
-   Groom & plan actions required for a maintainable Head explorer
-   Break “align gaps” feature into smaller chunks (at least on- /off-chain) and groom it
-   Review the spec & discuss individual aborts with researchers (a bigger open question)
