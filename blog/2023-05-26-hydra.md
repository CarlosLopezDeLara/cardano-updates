## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team accomplished several important tasks. They held their
monthly review meeting and drafted the report for May. They made progress on
implementing the first end-to-end journey for external commits using "Option A"
for normal UTxOs, while still considering "Option B". The team also integrated a
Spanish translation contributed by the community, created micro-benchmarks for
transaction validation and deserialization, and made improvements to
hydra-node's version reporting. Last but not least, they implemented the ability
to commit multiple UTxOs to a head at once.
