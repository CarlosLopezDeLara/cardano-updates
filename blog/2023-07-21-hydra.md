## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team updated the specification to align with recent
off-chain protocol changes, completed refactoring the snapshot emission
in preparation for event-sourced protocol logic, and updated to GHC
9.2.7, resulting in improved compile times and slightly smaller Plutus
scripts.
