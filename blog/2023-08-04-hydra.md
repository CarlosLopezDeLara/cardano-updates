## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team achieved notable progress in various aspects of the
project. The team updated the use case section for auctions on the [/unstable](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/unstable/use-cases/)
branch of the website, improving the understanding of Hydra&rsquo;s applicability.

From the development side, the team successfully completed event-sourced
persistence, a key enhancement in the project&rsquo;s architecture which improves
off-chain transaction processing performance. They also added a
&ldquo;submit-transaction&rdquo; endpoint to the API.

In addition to project-related progress, the team actively engaged in community
reviews for several catalyst proposals related to Hydra and Mithril,
contributing to the wider Cardano ecosystem.

Finally, the full report for the month of July was also published [here](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/monthly/2023-07).
