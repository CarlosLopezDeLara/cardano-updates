## High level summary
The open fronts that the crypto team is working on are:
* cardano-base: E2E tests for BLS bindings and KES agent 
* Sidechains: Implement ECC chip and Rescue hash primitives for ATMS
* mithril: Full node verifier

## Low level summary
### cardano-base
* RawBearer API in ouroboros-network-framework (https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4395); blocked due to issue with windows' localSnocket. Trying to resolve.
* Adapting cardano-base for direct memory transfers between mlocked RAM and file descriptors [#317](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-base/pull/317).
* Above, blocked by the simplification of typeclasses [#404](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-base/pull/404).
* Provided e2e test cases to the testing team with aggregated signatures and schnorr signatures for the BLS bindings
### Mithril
* Implementation of Full Node Verifier [#939](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/pull/939)
### Sidechains
* [ECC chip](https://github.com/input-output-hk/sidechains-zk/tree/master/prover/src/ecc) implemented for JubJub over BLS12-381
* [Rescue chip](https://github.com/input-output-hk/sidechains-zk/tree/master/prover/src/rescue) implemented for hashing.
* Currently working on Schnorr signature (which uses the above constraints)
