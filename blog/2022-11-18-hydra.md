## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team released version `0.8.1`, which includes several fixes and a user-wished extension of the persistence introduced by `0.8.0` of replaying server outputs to make clients like the `hydra-tui` be aware of the latest `hydra-node` state. The team also worked on the specification and closing gaps in the on-chain scripts, collaborated with the educatio team on a Hydra tutorial and also renamed the repository from `hydra-poc` to [`hydra`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra)!

## What did the team achieve this week

- Implemented replaying of server outputs to address [#580](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/issues/580)
- Released version 0.8.1 containing this and other fixes [Release notes](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/releases/tag/0.8.1)

- Collaborated with the education team on a Hydra tutorial.
- Discovered and discussed issues with the &ldquo;seen ledger&rdquo;.
