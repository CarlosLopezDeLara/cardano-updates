## High-level summary

This week, the Hydra team improved the commit process with support for inline
datums. They simplified the chain layer by refactoring how the chain state is
persisted. Updates to the Hydra tutorial were completed, including CI workflows
to keep it up-to-date. The team engaged in discussions with researchers about
incremental commits & decommits, and drafted an architectural decision record
for a resource-based API. They also explored simpler solutions for the upcoming
network resilience feature.

## What did the team achieve this week

-   Support InlineScriptDatum in commit
    [#1043](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1043)
-   Refactored chain state persistency
    [#1049](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1049)
-   Completed tutorial updates (by adding CI and some cleanup)
    [#997](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/997)
-   Intersect Open Source committee meeting
-   Experimented with various models to better express the \"Network
    resilience problem\" to find a KISS solution for
    [#188](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/188)
-   Drafted and discussed incremental de-/commit features within team
    and with researchers
    [#199](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/199) and
    [#1057](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1057)
-   Created ADR for a resource based overhaul of the API
    [#1028](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/1028)

## What are the goals of next week

-   Meetup of Hydra & Mithril contributors in Nantes, France
-   Integrated cardano-api 8.15 to have GHC 9.6 support
-   A clear design for incremental commits (decommits are already
    understood)
-   An ADR for improving tx construction & observation to not need chain
    state
