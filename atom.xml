cursor API that was needed to implement LMDB range reads, which is in turn
required for the implementation of the UTxO HD feature. We added tables to
several tests in for the UTxO HD feature, which increases our confidence in the
correctness of the prototype. The mempool property tests are close to being
completed. Also, we finished the LSM tree tuning algorithm.</p><p>On the Genesis front we started simplifying the BlockFetch logic with
CSJ-specific workloads in mind. </p><p>We are also documenting the Block Diffusion Pipelining feature, and added a
high-level overview of consensus to the top level documentation of
<code>ouroboros-network</code>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="workstreams">Workstreams<a class="hash-link" href="#workstreams" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="utxo-hd-prototype">UTxO HD prototype<a class="hash-link" href="#utxo-hd-prototype" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We merged the implementation of a monadic cursor API (<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/lmdb-simple/pull/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#1</a>)) which was
needed to solve a bug with LMDB range-reads. After this PR was merged, we focused on
bridging the gap between the <code>lmdb-simple</code> interface and consensus by facilitating
using <code>lmdb-simple</code>'s cursor API without <code>Serialise</code> constraints (<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/lmdb-simple/pull/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#3</a>).</p><p>We refactored the backing store property tests to use <code>quickcheck-lockstep</code>
(<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4081" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#4081</a>).</p><p>We added tables to the mock ledger in the UTxO-HD feature branch
(<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4184" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#4184</a>). Every test that used to run with <code>SimpleBlocks</code> now uses
tables. This will enable us to exercise the UTxO HD mempool integration by
leveraging the existing mempool property-tests. The new state-machine
property-tests are still needed for testing the parallel behaviour of the
mempool.</p><p>Our work on the mempool state-machine tests revealed the need for improvements
in the <code>quickcheck-state-machine</code> library. Parallel testing assumed that the
state machine did not have access to mutable references. However, the mempool
tests require the use of such mutable references for mocking the ledger
interface. As a result, our parallel tests were failing with rather obscure
messages. @Jasagredo submitted a pull request (<a href="https://github.com/stevana/quickcheck-state-machine/pull/12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#12</a>) that allows for
new mutable references to be created at each run of the state machine.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="backing-store-property-tests">Backing store property tests<a class="hash-link" href="#backing-store-property-tests" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lsm-tree-implementation">LSM tree implementation<a class="hash-link" href="#lsm-tree-implementation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We finished the LSM Tree tuning algorithm.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stake-driven-data-diffusion-release-for-relays">Stake-Driven Data Diffusion Release for Relays<a class="hash-link" href="#stake-driven-data-diffusion-release-for-relays" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>IOG networking team decided to release the <em>Stake-Driven Data Diffusion with
Robust Optimised Peer Selection</em> also more commonly known as <em>P2P</em>.  In the
last update, we informed about a performance regression, but it turns out it
only affects block producers, and thus we highly advise against running it on
such nodes.  Further investigation is required to find the cause of it.</p><p>On IOG's benchmarking cluster we have seen quite a good performance improvement
on block propagation itself.  The cluster is running a static topology with
valency 6 (each node is connected to 6 other nodes).  In which every of the 50
nodes are block producers.  The setup of this network is the same as mainnet.
We've seen 40-50% performance improvement on block propagation comparing to the
same cluster deployed with the same topology but using non-P2P nodes.  We think
this performance improvement is caused by using full duplex connections.  Quite
likely the transaction traffic floating in both directions on the same TCP
connection helps to keep the TCP window open.  Note that in a cluster of 50
nodes with valency 6 the probability of having at least one duplex connection
is more than 50%.  We don't expect the same improvement on mainnet because the
network is much wider and the transaction traffic is not as large.</p><p>Just before the release we squashed two small bugs:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4163" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue #4163</a> - top level integration bug in <code>keep-alive</code>;</li><li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue #4177</a> - a bug in <code>outbound-governor</code>;</li><li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4165" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PR #4165</a> - a fix <code>cardano-ping</code> support of <code>NodeToNodeV_10</code>.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="peer-sharing">Peer Sharing<a class="hash-link" href="#peer-sharing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We were carrying a review of <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peer sharing PR</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="deltaq">DeltaQ<a class="hash-link" href="#deltaq" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Neil Davies was invited to give a guest lecture entitled <code>Avoiding System Catastrophes</code> at <a href="https://uclouvain.be/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UCLouvain</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-have-we-achieve-last-sprint">What have we achieve last sprint<a class="hash-link" href="#what-have-we-achieve-last-sprint" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4163" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue #4163</a>: we found out that a control message is not passed to the

collectively, placing ever more trust in them.</p><p>Are they worthy of this trust?  Our need for them to be ‘fit-for-purpose’ goes
well beyond notions of functional correctness (i.e. never getting the wrong
answer). We need them to deliver the desired outcomes in a timely, robust,
reliable, resilient fashion, at scale and in a sustainable way (both
economically and environmentally).</p><p>This all sounds like a worthy aspiration, but what would be a practical
approach to capturing and reasoning about these issues? How can we ensure that
systems can meet their fit-for-purpose objectives, not just in their design but
as they are deployed, encounter the imperfect world, are scaled to become
economic, and proceed into ongoing maintenance?</p><p>This talk will illustrate how the notions of Outcomes and Quality Attenuation
(as captured by ‘∆Q’) are being used to both frame the necessary notions and
provide a basis for assuring the refinement and reification of such systems,
from initial concept to operational infrastructure.</p></blockquote><p>You can download the slides from <a target="_blank" href="/cardano-updates/assets/files/2022-11-24-UCL-60c46564c5dee25b0060304c060ab1cf.pdf">here</a>.</p>]]></content>

The community facing aspects of the Conway ledger era will be very minimal,
but it will pave the way for introducing liquid democracy.
The details can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/projects/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
We do not yet have a formal specification for the Conway era.

Briefly, the Conway ledger era will:</p><ul><li>introduce SPO voting for hard forks (in the spirit of the now abandoned <a href="https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/318" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIP-47</a>)</li><li>provide an on-chain mechanism for rotating the governance keys</li><li>re-plumb the ledger rules involving governance to be in line with <a href="https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIP-1694</a></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="versioned-cbor">Versioned CBOR<a class="hash-link" href="#versioned-cbor" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We now have the ability to easily tie our serialization schemes to the Cardano
major protocol version.
We still aim to preserve backwards compatibility as much as possible, but we now have a principled
plan for resolving problems (see <a href="https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/372" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIP-ledger-cbor</a>).
In particular, we can now address several long standing issues, such as
<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/issues/2444" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue-2444</a>, <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/issues/2965" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue-2965</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/issues/3003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue-3003</a>. </p><p>The final (and massive!) pull request which brought us the versioning is <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3138" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-3138</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="deposit-tracking">Deposit tracking<a class="hash-link" href="#deposit-tracking" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The draft pull request which was exploring how best to track individual deposits
is much closer now to being ready to take out of draft (<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-3127</a>).
For background on the issue, see <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/issues/3113" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue-3113</a>.
This is quite an invasive change which effects many of our tests, which we are now addressing.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technical-debt">Technical debt<a class="hash-link" href="#technical-debt" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>As always, we keep working on technical debt.
We have deduplicated a some things: <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3129" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-3129</a>, <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3162" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-3162</a>.
We have memoized a problematic computation (though more due diligence is needed before we can
merge): <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-3141</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="node-release">Node release<a class="hash-link" href="#node-release" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We have been helping with the node release efforts.

part of our work on UTxO HD, we improved the Haskell support for LMDB. We also
spent time working on the LSM tree prototype, and designed a parameter tuning
algorithm for it. Regarding our work on Genesis, our investigation of the
"plateaus" pointed at the <code>TICKF</code> slowdown on era boundaries as culprit. This
led us to developing a caching strategy that will not only remove the
aforementioned "plateaus", but can help alleviating the growing block production

CBOR serialization. This was an enormous effort, but it will solve a host of problems that we have
had since the Shelley phase. It will take time to properly review it, and we will
need to put in a lot of effort to integrate it with the downstream components, but this is  a huge
milestone. Additionally, we have a new CIP proposing a deprecation cycle for the transaction
serialization schemes.</p><p>We also have a draft pull request that reworks how deposits are tracked. Users of the system will
not notice any difference, but it is a necessary change needed to prepare the way for
decentralizing the governance of Cardano.</p><p>Finally, we continued to address technical debt. In particular, we continued to make progress on
bringing coherency and consistency to the code base with a common naming convention, and
improving some error messages.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lower-level-summary">Lower level summary<a class="hash-link" href="#lower-level-summary" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>We have a pull request up for our new versioned CBOR serialization.
When we encounter a problem with our deserializers, it can be very difficult to implement a fix.
It is difficult because we can only fix such issues during a hard fork, and leading up to the
hard fork we must maintain two serializations for the same type in order to not cause unintended
network splitting (the problematic version must be used before the hard fork,
and the fixed version is used afterwards).
This can be especially tricky with the <code>FromCBOR</code> typeclass, since it is not always easy to
search for where all the problematic uses are located.
The new versioned CBOR serialization allows us to gracefully handle this transition.
See [<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3138" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-3138</a>].</li><li>We proposed a CIP for backwards compatibility of the transaction serialization schemes.
See [<a href="https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/372" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-372</a>].</li><li>We have draft for the new deposit tracking.
This draft is not as memory efficient as the final version will be,
but it is a sufficient proof of concept that we can write property tests against, ensuring
that we have not changed the semantics.
We will optimize after we are sure of the correctness.
See [<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-3127</a>].</li><li>We now provide better support for debugging failed Plutus scripts in an important helper
function, named <code>evaluateTransactionExecutionUnits</code>.
In particular, it now returns all the information needed to rerun the script with exactly the
same arguments. This feature will end up appearing in the CLI and other tools from the Plutus
tools team.
See [<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3135" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-3135</a>].</li><li>We did a lot more renaming to bring coherency and consistency to the code base.

In particular
we compared the performance of different jump intervals, which, somewhat
surprisingly, do not make a significant difference. In particular, we are seeing
periodic "plateaus" where the chain-sync tip does not progress, but they are
much longer for the prototype. Our hypothesis is that this seem to be due to a
combination of the garbage collector (GC) pauses, and the actual time it takes
the non-dynamo chain-sync peers to jump to the tip of the slot of the dynamo
fragment.</p><p>In the coming weeks we will try to shorten these plateaus via a combination of
tweaking GC options and less synchronisation in the CSJ governor.</p><p>The following plot shows the performance of the chain-sync jumping prototype
using different jumping intervals. It compares the syncing progress by plotting
the slots of adopted blocks against time. The baseline is still faster, however
it is worth noting that the current prototype already achieves a significant
speedup when compared to the naive approach of simply running full chain-sync
with all peers.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/cardano-updates/assets/images/2022-11-02-csj-vs-baseline-9fd0e0e080975cc6cfbe035731b4f38d.svg" width="998" height="445" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The second plot shows the syncing progress sliced to a chosen ~5min interval,
and includes, in addition to the slots of adopted blocks, the slots of the tip
of the ChainSync fragment. This allows us to see how far ahead of the selected
tip the CS dynamo is, i.e. how much room we have for BlockFetch not to get
stalled. It shows periodic behaviour (due to the forecasting limit), and shows
that the CS fragment tip is not progressing for significant periods
("plateaus").</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/cardano-updates/assets/images/2022-11-02-csj-vs-baseline-sliced-77ff018af70191b4122b1e7cf56c79b8.svg" width="998" height="445" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technical-debt">Technical debt<a class="hash-link" href="#technical-debt" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4098" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clarified</a> a

<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/formal-ledger-specifications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">formal ledger repository</a>
in place of a LaTeX spec for the next ledger era, and have added a lot of basic infrastructure
to the model. In particular, we now have a lot of support for axiomatic set theory.
While the next ledger era is still in the design phase, most of the team remains working
on technical debt.
In particular, we have moved a lot more code out of the Shelley specific modules and into
a ledger core module, we have finished up our benchmarking around the problematic <code>TICKF</code>
ledger transition (while improving the performance), made conveniences to the development
environment, cleaned up all the recent changes to the cost model, added a lot of documentation,
fixed some flaky tests, and deleted some dead code.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lower-level-summary">Lower level summary<a class="hash-link" href="#lower-level-summary" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="axiomatic-set-theory">Axiomatic Set Theory<a class="hash-link" href="#axiomatic-set-theory" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The formal ledger model now has support for much of the set theory that we make use of in

This is a module which
makes our CBOR serialization round-trip tests much more robust, and will also hopefully
help enforce the mandate for downstream libraries to never re-serialize data that needs
to be hashed. See [<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3073" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-3073</a>] and [<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3095" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-3095</a>]
(we cannot merge 3095 just yet, due to a preference for merging other features).</li><li>We have finished our long analysis of the problematic <code>TICKF</code> transition.
We now have a lot of benchmarks surrounding this code, and have added performance improvements.

improves our productivity by providing us with constant feedback from the type checker.
See [<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3112" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-3112</a>].</li><li>After much activity on the cost model, we have done some final clean up of the code.

sharing.  We found and fixed an important bug recently introduced in one of the
components of p2p networking stack (fortunately never released).  Together with
a fix, we designed a unit test diffusion simulation as well as quickcheck
property test (both could reproduce it). We also changed the code in a way that
if such a bug is reintroduced in the future, it will be obvious to diagnose.

The results where
unlike what we see on the mainnet.  We found a possible misconfiguration of the
cluster (caused by 0 TTL on domain names), which could be the direct cause of
it.  We wrote a PR which rules out such misconfiguration.  We are awaiting on
the next benchmarking results.  See more at:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4106" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ouroboros-network#4106</a></p><p>We also started working on P2P single relay release.  The PR

different aspects of the UTxO HD prototype: era transitions, mempool, and
backing store. Thanks to these tests we were able to uncover a bug in the
prototype. On the Genesis front, we benchmarked a different version of the
ChainSync jumping prototype to try to improve its performance, but this did not
result in any noticeable speedup.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="high-level-status-report">High-level status report<a class="hash-link" href="#high-level-status-report" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>Finish the UTxO HD prototype: on track.<ul><li>We focused on increasing test coverage for the UTxO-HD prototype:<ul><li>We started implementing Cadano-eras transition property-tests.</li><li>We started implementing state-machine property-tests for the mempool.</li><li>We merged the mempool rewrite.</li><li>We started working on state-machine tests for the backing store.

which are needed for making sure that the ledger tables get updated in the
right way when we move from one era to the next. There are at the moment two
important transitions.</p><ul><li>Byron to Shelley: where all the UTxO is transferred from in-memory Byron
state (which has no tables) to the ledger tables of the Shelley state.</li><li>Shelley to Allegra: where the AVVM addresses must be deleted.</li></ul><p>We have tests for the Byron to Shelley transitions. We are working on adding

mempool</a>.
The mempool is currently tested via pure property tests, and use a ledger
state without tables. With the introduction of UTxO HD, testing the concurrent
behavior of the mempool became of crucial importance (eg now we have to
acquire locks to flush the backing store). In addition, we need to test a
ledger state with tables. These needs led to the creation of a new set of
property tests. In particular we aim to run parallel state-machine tests that
exercise the mempool in a way similar to how the node would make use of it.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="backing-store-property-tests">Backing store property tests<a class="hash-link" href="#backing-store-property-tests" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>We started working on <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4081" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">state-machine tests for the backing
store</a> that UTxO
HD uses. The property tests uncovered errors in the range-reads implementation
of the LMDB backing store. To facilitate fixing this bug, we made
<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/lmdb-simple/pull/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">changes</a> to the Haskell
LMDB bindings.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="benchmarking-the-csj-prototype">Benchmarking the CSJ prototype<a class="hash-link" href="#benchmarking-the-csj-prototype" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Prompted by previous benchmarks showing significant improvements in sync time by
using more capabilities, we implemented a way to spread out the ChainSync
updates over a larger period instead of firing them all at the same time. This
didn't result in a noticeable speedup.</p><p>We also benchmarked the prototype with CSJ disabled (such that just the dynamo
peer is running ChainSync, but e.g. BlockFetch still sees all peers) to rule
out/confirm overhead by non-ChainSync (mainly BlockFetch) related components.
This results in era-specific behavior (speed is like the prototype in Byron, but
like the baseline in Shelley). This deserves a closer look in the future.</p><p>This diagram shows the respective syncing progress, starting at Genesis and

A lot of design work has begun for the next ledger era,
but we do not yet have anything concrete to share.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technical-debt-issues-completed">Technical debt issues completed<a class="hash-link" href="#technical-debt-issues-completed" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>[<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/issues/1676" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue-1676</a>][<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/2992" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-2992</a>] We have finally removed the ledger dependency on the
<code>cardano-prelude</code> package. It was barely used in the ledger repository, and it added a dependency
that we did not want to maintain. It was a bit difficult to remove, and we had
to coordinate removing it from cardano-base.
A lot ended up going into <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/2992" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-2992</a>, due to the coordination effort, and we ended
up updating Plutus as well.
This means that we've now also made a lot of progress on the problematic cost model serialization
issues described in <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/issues/2902" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue-2902</a>.
In particular, after we resolve <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/issues/3014" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue-3014</a>, we will not have to wait an epoch before
releasing a cost model for a new version of Plutus, as we had to do for the Vasil HF.</li><li>[<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/issues/3046" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue-3046</a>][<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3055" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-3055</a>] We moved a module that is now only used in Byron to a Byron package.</li><li>[<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/issues/3047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue-3047</a>][<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3054" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-3054</a>] We improved the interface to the <code>Value</code> (multi-asset) type.</li><li>[<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-3044</a>] We debugged and fixed a tricky compilation issue.

have added a <code>Cardano.Ledger.[Era].Core</code> module to each ledger era that has a TxBody class.
Most classes defined in the era should go in this new module.
We also re-export the <code>Cardno.Ledger.Core</code> module and the previous <code>Cardano.Ledger.[Era].Core</code>
modules from each era.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technical-debt-in-progress">Technical debt in progress<a class="hash-link" href="#technical-debt-in-progress" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>[<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/issues/3034" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue-3034</a>][<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/issues/3035" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue-3035</a>][<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/issues/4421" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">node-issue-4421</a>] We are continuing to write benchmarks to understand exactly where
all the time is being spent on executing the <code>TICKF</code> transition.
The consolidation of the per-stake-credential stake distribution to the per-stake-pool
distribution does seem to account for a large amount of time (near a second as written, which we
have down to about half a second with some optimizations),
but this does not account for everything.
Applying the reward update may also be a big contributing factor.</li><li>[<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3033" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-3033</a>][<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3038" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-3038</a>][<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/pull/3041" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-3041</a>] A separate team is working on upgrading all the

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul><li>We proposed a fix for the performance degradation observed when running
distributed multi-node benchmarks in the UTxO HD feature branch. While this
fixed the problems observed when running local benchmarks, it broke the
<code>ThreadNet</code> tests due to concurrency issues. Therefore, we think it is wise to
start redesigning the UTxO HD mempool integration.</li><li>We did several rounds of code review on the alternative implementation of
diff-sequences required by the UTxO HD feature based on the idea of
anti-diffs. This alternative implementation is close to being merged, and the
next step is to integrate this to the UTxO HD branch, so that we can run
ad-hoc replaying and syncing from scratch benchmarks and compare these with
the baseline. The micro-benchmarks we elaborated for the alternative
implementation show speedups of up to 4x, so we are optimistic about the
performance of replaying and syncing from scratch benchmarks, however it is
important to notice that <em>due to the nature of UTxO HD</em> we will still be
slower than the baseline.</li><li>The final draft of the Genesis implementation specification is ready for
review.</li><li>We implemented a prototype for the happy path of Genesis' ChainSync Jumping
(CSJ). The prototype is slower than the baseline, however it is not the latest
version of the prototype and the jump interval is very small.</li><li>Work on integrating Conway has <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3971#issuecomment-1252524031" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stopped</a> since
priorities have changed.</li><li>We started work on benchmarking epoch-boundaries and epoch overhead
<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4014" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pr-4014</a>. To this end, we made use of a modified version of our
<code>db-analyser</code> tool. We ran the new benchmarking setup using the Cardano
mainnet chain, and we can see that block tick and application take
substantially longer at epoch boundaries, although there are a couple of slots
during an epoch in which these computations take more than normal. We notified
the ledger team about these findings. We will use this modified version of
<code>db-analyser</code> to investigate the epoch overhead.</li></ul><h1>Workstreams</h1><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="utxo-hd">UTxO HD<a class="hash-link" href="#utxo-hd" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li><p>Spent quite some time investigating the root cause of the degradation in
performance observed in the benchmarks. We run the <code>make forge-stress</code>
benchmarks locally in order to debug this behavior.</p><ul><li><p>Transaction batching doesn't make a notable difference in the outcome
(considering we are using the in-memory backend).</p></li><li><p>The mempool batching implementation required asynchronous transaction
validation which is a violation of the <code>LocalTxSubmission</code> protocol
contract and therefore if we continued on that route, the impact would
have been quite big.</p></li><li><p>The STM logic we implemented by using a <code>TMVar</code> for the mempool internal
state was buggy and under certain circumstances it seemed to lock.
Reverting the mempool internal state to be stored in a <code>TVar</code> seems to
solve this problem.</p></li><li><p>The results we get after this change look almost identical to the ones
from the baseline.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The anti-diff prototype (PR
#3997)</a> has
been reviewed and is close to being merged.</p><ul><li>A follow-up issue (<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue
#4010</a>)
to integrate the anti-diff prototype in the various <code>consensus</code> packages
was created. A first version of the integration exists, and all tests
pass. A next step is to get some indication of the "real" performance gain
by profiling <code>db-analyser</code> (or <code>cardano-node</code>).</li></ul></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="genesis">Genesis<a class="hash-link" href="#genesis" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li><p>Final draft of the Genesis implementation specification, now up for review.</p></li><li><p>Local benchmark setup for parameter tuning via the happy path ChainSync
Jumping (CSJ) prototype (<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Issue 3987</a>).</p><ul><li><p>Context: Our Genesis design requires us to check in with a large (~20)
number of servers periodically while syncing. These servers are offered
jump requests via the ChainSync protocol (hence the name), which they can
accept or decline. If a peer declines, the Genesis rule allows us to
determine whether a node actually has a better chain.</p></li><li><p>The "happy path" is when no peer declines a jump. We want this to have
close to no overhead compared to status quo, i.e. syncing without Genesis.</p></li><li><p>We implemented a prototype for this happy path, and are now starting to
test in various configurations (number of peers, latency, bandwidth) to
tune the performance of ChainSync jumping, i.e. how complicated our logic
of choosing when to jump needs to be.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p></li><li><p>Simulated connection: 50 MBit/s, 50ms latency</p></li><li><p>Jump interval: 3000 slots (on the low end, could be increased to up to
<code>3k/f</code>)</p></li><li><p>Red: baseline (1.35.3), one peer in topology file</p></li><li><p>Blue: Preliminary version of our prototype, with 10 peers.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/cardano-updates/assets/images/happy-path-csj-prototype-prelim-5bbe2e2a20a2740e6238a7c73e618168.svg" width="654" height="459" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>It is slower by about ~30%, but it is not the latest version of the

to the <code>babbage</code> era. This has been the first time that we have been able to see
what a minimal ledger era looks like. We have finished this task, modulo any
integration issues that might come up. The only thing that the <code>conway</code> era
does differently from the <code>babbage</code> era is provide support for rotating
the master keys using the hardfork combinator's state translation.
We may end up adding features to the <code>conway</code> era, but it is a nice exercise
seeing what it looks like to get a minimal ledger era supported in all the
downstream components.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="addressing-technical-debt">Addressing technical debt<a class="hash-link" href="#addressing-technical-debt" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We have been addressing technical debt, mostly in an effort to make the

"anti-diff" prototype proposes an alternative approach to keeping track of
sequences (more specifically, <code>FingerTree</code>s) of diffs. These diff sequences
are a component of the in-memory parts of the ledger state in UTxO-HD. Since
the consensus code often requires the cumulative diff of a sequence of diffs,
the current implementation "caches" cumulative diffs of each subtree in the
diff sequence. This caching allows relatively fast reconstruction of the total
cumulative diff, but this caching proved to incur a non-negligible cost: when
we manipulate diff sequences through splits and appends, we force re-computing
a logarithmic number of caches. This is problematic, since we often split and
append in consensus: we split when we flush diffs to a backing store or when
we roll back blocks, and we append when pushing blocks. The new approach
should reduce the overhead of this caching.</p><p>We implemented micro-benchmarks for the "anti-diff" prototype: we
first generate a sequence of commands (<code>Forward</code>, <code>Push</code>, <code>Flush</code>, or
<code>Rollback</code>) through a simulation, after which we measure the performance of
applying the commands to a diff sequence. In this context, <code>Forward</code> means
forwarding of values through a diff, whereas <code>Rollback</code> means switching to
a different fork by rolling back diffs/blocks and pushing new ones.
Moreover, we compare the performance for the two implementations: the
"legacy" approach, and the anti-diff approach.</p><p>Some preliminary results were positive, but we needed to revisit the
benchmark's configuration to obtain more definitive results. After a
discussion with @dcoutts and the consensus team about this configuration
(e.g., number of commands generated, choice of the security parameter <code>k</code>),

prototype, was repeatedly executed for <code>18.27</code> seconds (wall-clock time),
its predicted mean CPU time was <code>2.527</code> seconds and means of individual
samples do not often diverge from it further than <code>± 47</code> milliseconds
(double standard deviation). We also configure the RTS to collect GC
statistics, which enables <code>tasty-bench</code> to estimate and report memory usage.
This data is reported as per <code>RTSStats</code> fields: <code>allocated_bytes</code>,
<code>copied_bytes</code> and <code>max_mem_in_use_bytes</code>. So, the output of the first
benchmark says that a total of <code>2.1 GB</code> of memory was allocated, that a
total of <code>544 MB</code> of memory were copied, and that the peak memory in usage
was <code>2.2 GB</code>. We read the output for the second benchmark in the same way.</p><p>Furthermore, the benchmark compares the mean CPU times for
both the anti-diff and legacy approaches: In this case, the mean CPU time
for the anti-diff approach is <code>~0.23x</code> the mean CPU time for the legacy
approach. Conversely, the mean CPU time for the legacy approach is
<code>1 / 0.23 ~= 4.35x</code> the mean CPU time for the anti-diff approach. We will
call <code>0.23x</code> the <em>improvement factor</em>. We will call <code>4.35x</code> the <em>speedup</em>.</p><p>Note that these improvement factors (and reported results) are subject to
noise, randomness, the specific configuration parameters, and the whims
of statistics. Data reported by <code>tasty-bench</code> is only of indicative and
comparative significance.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="results">Results<a class="hash-link" href="#results" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>For each of the 4 scenarios, we list the results of running the anti-diff and
legacy approaches 5 times. We run the benchmarks 5 times to get an indication
of whether the results are similar across multiple runs. Furthermore, we
calculate the accompanying <em>ranges</em> (if applicable) of improvement factors and
speedups.</p><p>Note also the decrease in total bytes allocated and total bytes copied for
the anti-diff approach compared to the legacy approach.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="default-configuration">Default configuration<a class="hash-link"
