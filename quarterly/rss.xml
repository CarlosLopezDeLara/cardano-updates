release of P2P.  We fixed a number of small late bugs, and concluded QA
&amp; performance testing.  Although it was discovered a regression in performance
of  block production when P2P is enabled, relaying with P2P performs better
comparing to a non p2p.  We concluded that this is not a blocker for the Single
Relay Release which is planned shortly.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/4019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peer sharing</a> has gone through review and final review is
just being done right now.  After merging it will still be disabled (hidden
behind a flag) as it's not safe without eclipse evasion.  We started
implementing light peer sharing (i.e. include inbound peers into known peer set
of the outbound governor).</p><p>We started a detailed eclipse evasion design, it will continue in the next
quarter.</p><p>Armando Santos delivered a talk at the <a href="https://sites.uclouvain.be/OPODIS2022/armando-details.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ODOPIS 2022</a> conference on principles
of distributed systems in Brussels.  The slides are available <a href="https://sites.uclouvain.be/OPODIS2022/slides/OPODIS2022-slides-Santos.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>Neil Davies gave an invited seminar on <code>DeltaQ</code> at Université Catholique de
Louvain.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="next-steps">Next steps<a class="hash-link" href="#next-steps" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We will work towards the next release of P2P for block producer nodes.  This includes:</p><ul><li>analysing performance regression for BP nodes when using P2P</li><li>finish the work on controlling the block forger through node kernel (<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pr #3800</a>)</li><li>address <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3907" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue #3907</a> and write a script to analyse deployment of P2P relays</li></ul><p>We would like also to push forward eclipse evasion.   Although most of the work
has be done already the release of <code>io-sim</code> on <code>Hackage</code> will happen in the
next quarter.</p><p>We would also like to address <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4244" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chain-sync timeout issue</a> recently
diagnosed by Karl Knutsson.</p><p>If time permits we would also like to address some technical debt, especially:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3387" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enable nothunk in diffusion tests</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/4085" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refactor diffusion testnet simulation</a></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="risks">Risks<a class="hash-link" href="#risks" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The performance regression for block producer with P2P needs to be investigated
in the near future.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="open-source-quarterly-update">Open Source Quarterly Update<a class="hash-link" href="#open-source-quarterly-update" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2022-11---2023-01">2022-11 - 2023-01<a class="hash-link" href="#2022-11---2023-01" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#summary" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In the last quarter the open-source initiative delivered a comprehensive report
on the state of our repositories.  As part of this work stream we
identified the key open-source repositories for the cardano project across all
the projects  From a list of more than 500 repositories (some of which are
forks) we identified key repositories which constitute the core of Cardano.
20 of them were identified as to be transferred to the future MBO which will
govern Cardano development.  Some where excluded (like <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>io-sim</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/typed-protocols" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>typed-protocols</code></a>), to be govern by IOG, since they have a much broader
application than Cardano itself, and thus we think their open-source future
will be better outside of the Cardano umbrella.</p><p>Christian Taylor identified a number of ways we can improve our repositories to
make them more attractive for open-source contributions by analysing each of
them.  This includes adding or improving various documentation files, like
<code>CONTRIBUTING</code> files, adding code of conduct, improving readme files, issue
&amp; pull request templates etc.  Christian also computed various interesting
metrics which gives a very good insight into the development practices: e.g.
average merge ratio, average number of reviews, comments and many more!  The
presentation is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/127IFEavlrZeeoFrVXFYWzSt0ugOkSL7isxjyM1vmMzQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>We followed with work on the <a href="https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-engineering-handbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cardano Engineering Handbook</a>.  We included
a standard code of conduct which is now used by most important projects in the
Cardano space.  We included <code>cardano-node</code>'s security policy and added
a responsible disclosure policy.  We also described how roles and
responsibilities should be clarified.  This progress was made by
a collaborative effort of the Cardano Core, Plutus and Architecture teams, and
it wouldn't be possible without Michael Peyton Jones, Arnaud Bailly, Kevin
Hammond, Jared Corduan and Marcin Szamotulski.</p><p>We also improved the documentation of key repositories, by adding description,
improving their <code>README</code> file &amp; <code>CONTRIBUTING</code> files, adding code of conducts
following the <a href="https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-engineering-handbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cardano Engineering Handbook</a>.  This includes improvements to:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>ouroboros-network</code></a> (both <code>network</code> &amp; <code>consensus</code>)</li><li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>cardano-ledger</code></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>cardano-node</code></a></li></ul><p>And also</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>io-sim</code></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/typed-protocols" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>typed-protocols</code></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-prelude" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>cardano-prelude</code></a> (work in progress)</li></ul><p>The work was carried by Marcin Szamotulski, Addie Girouard and  Jared Corduan. </p><p>In this quarter we also identified a number of projects which can be published to
<code>Hackage</code> (Haskell's package repository) or <code>crate</code> (Rust package repository).
The list contains 21 packages, 2 of which (<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog-extras" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>hedgehog-extras</code></a> and
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/quickcheck-dynamic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>quickcheck-dynamic</code></a>) are already published on Hackage and another 5 (from
the <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>io-sim</code></a> repository) are close to be published.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="detailed-log">Detailed log<a class="hash-link" href="#detailed-log" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The progress of the open-source project is tracked in <a href="https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/60/views/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this project</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

given the exponential increase in the cost of finding bugs as they are closer

only, so the consensus-wide speedup is less than <code>4x</code>.</p></li><li><p>We integrated the "anti-diff" prototype into the UTxO HD feature branch.</p></li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="genesis">Genesis<a class="hash-link" href="#genesis" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><ul><li>We wrote a simulator that demonstrates soundness of an abstract implementation

Cardano Foundation.</li></ul><p>Duncan has been making progress with the input endorsers demo. His simulation
provides a useful animated visualisation and live quantification of behaviour
of the modeled design.</p><p>We also improved our e2e diffusion simulation by implementing header-body
split, similar to what the real implementation does.</p><p>We also made some advances towards our future goals of P2P release for block
producer nodes (<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/pull/3800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pr #3800</a> - in review) &amp; for Daedalus users
(<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-network/issues/3968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pr #3690</a> - merged).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="detailed-log">Detailed log<a class="hash-link" href="#detailed-log" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li><p>We expanded diffusion simulation with block-fetch protocol bringing it closer
to the production system.</p></li><li><p>We addressed some additional technical depth in diffusion simulation</p></li><li><p>We slightly improved documentation &amp; CI of io-sim and typed-protocols
repositories for open-source contributors.</p></li><li><p>We closed a number of issues towards publishing io-sim on Hackage (only two
essential issues are left open).</p></li><li><p>We pushed a branch of typed-protocols which captures one of the developer UX
problems in the API which we need to solve.</p></li><li><p>We identified and fixed an issue related to systemd sockets.</p></li><li><p>We identified and fixed an issue in consensus initialisation not giving
feedback on early errors.</p></li><li><p>We deployed RT View, identified a number of issues which were communicated to
the performance &amp; monitoring team.</p></li><li><p>We finished high level &amp; detailed design of peer sharing, very early
implementation of peer sharing is done (note that peer sharing cannot be
safely deployed without eclipse evasion &amp; genesis).</p></li><li><p>We finished high level design of eclipse evasion, and started working on
a detailed design.</p></li><li><p>We were assigned the role of release engineer for 1.35.5 release (the P2P
single relay release); we prepared a cardano-node for 1.35.5 release which
contains more than 130 patches of just network stack improvements done over
last few months.</p></li><li><p>We diagnosed and fixed an tricky bug in the peer state actions (a component
which sits between outbound governor and connection manager). That bug was
introduced earlier this year and never released. It was caught by the QA
testing framework. We expanded our diffusion simulation to cover such case and
also mitigated a chance for reintroducing such a bug in future.</p></li><li><p>We identified and quite likely mitigated a misconfiguration in the
benchmarking cluster (next benchmarking run will confirm our hypothesis).</p></li><li><p>We simplified the format of p2p topology file, we got positive feedback from
SPOs.</p></li><li><p>We raised severities of some of the logging messages, which is an important
improvement for SPOs, exchanges and other users of the system.</p></li><li><p>We worked on input endorsers simulation which gives both animated and
quantified live feedback on network operation, using a simplified model of
a TCP/IP network. </p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="next-quarter">Next quarter<a class="hash-link" href="#next-quarter" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li><p>Release the Single Relay P2P Release <code>1.35.5</code>.</p></li><li><p>Carry on with Peer Sharing (review, testing).</p></li><li><p>Deliver a talk at <a href="https://sites.uclouvain.be/OPODIS2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conference on Principles of Distributed Systems 2022</a> in Brussels, Belgium.</p></li><li><p>Present Detailed Design of Eclipse Evasion and start implementation phase.</p></li><li><p>Work on P2P Block Producer release.</p></li><li><p>Carry on with publishing of <code>io-sim</code> on <code>Hackage</code>.</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>
